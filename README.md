# Home_Security_System
* Home Security System using Arduino.
* cpature images of the intruder.
* Prerequisites : Good Knowledge ofInternet Of Things.

## Softwares Used:
* Arduino IDE.

## Hardwares Used:
* Arduino Uno.
* PIR Sensor(Motion Sensor).
* Cable For Arduino UNO(USB A to B).
* Light Dependent Resistor(LDR).
* Bread Board
* Light Emitting Diode (LED).
* Samrtphone

## Working:
* PIR Sensor Detects the motion, this in turn lights up the LED.
* LDR senses the light that falls upon it, this in turn decreses the resistance resulting in triggering of volume down button of phone to capture images through camera of the intruder.
